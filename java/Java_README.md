## 2. Sensor App

You will be running the following steps from the command line.

### Setup

First (in the GitPod terminal), do `source .env` to set environment variables for your app.

Next `cd java`.

Execute a `mvn clean install` to bring in the dependent packages and build everything.

The connection classes are `AstraConnection.java` and `CassandraConnection.java`.  The `AstraConnection` class extends the `CassandraConnection` super class, accounting for the Astra DB environment variables.  Take a minute to give those a look:
 - [AstraConnection](src/main/java/astraconnect/AstraConnection.java)
 - [CassandraConnection](src/main/java/astraconnect/CassandraConnection.java)

### Run stuff

ðŸ’» Run connectivity test:
```bash
java -jar target/examples-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
<details><summary>Show expected result</summary>

```
$> java -jar target/examples-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
[OK] Success
[OK] Welcome to Astra DB! Connected to Keyspace sensor_data
** Connected to cluster 'cndb' at data center 'us-east1' **
[shutdown_driver] Closing connection
```

_Note: You may see warnings for SLF4J.  These can be safely ignored._

</details>

ðŸ’» Run query Q3 as standalone exercise:
```bash
java -jar target/examples-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar ex_01_query_Q3 volcano-net
```
<details><summary>Show expected result</summary>

```
$> java -jar target/examples-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar ex_01_query_Q3 volcano-net
[OK] Success
[OK] Welcome to Astra DB! Connected to Keyspace sensor_data
** Querying sensors for network 'volcano-net' ...
      - Sensor s2001    (LAT=+44.46, LON=-110.83): accuracy = high  sensitivity = medium
      - Sensor s2002    (LAT=+44.46, LON=-110.83): accuracy = high  sensitivity = medium
[shutdown_driver] Closing connection
```

</details>

ðŸ’» Try to run the improved form of the same exercise, which uses prepared statements:
```bash
java -jar target/examples-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar ex_01B_query_Q3 volcano-net
```
> If you plan to run the same CQL statements over and over in your driver-based application
> (possibly with variable arguments), you should always employ prepared statements as they improve
> the performance by reducing the overhead. Thus this version of query Q3 is to be preferred.

## 3. Sensor API

ðŸ’» Start the API:
```bash
cd ../springjava
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

```

</details>

ðŸ’» With the API running, _in the other shell_ try to call the "Q3" endpoint (GET):
```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/sensors_by_network/volcano-net | jq
```
<details><summary>Show expected result</summary>

```
$> curl -s localhost:8080/sensors_by_network/volcano-net | jq
[
{
  "network": "volcano-net",
  "sensor": "s2001",
  "latitude": 44.460321,
  "longitude": -110.828151,
  "characteristics": {
    "accuracy": "high",
    "sensitivity": "medium"
  }
},
{
  "network": "volcano-net",
  "sensor": "s2002",
  "latitude": 44.463195,
  "longitude": -110.830124,
  "characteristics": {
    "accuracy": "high",
    "sensitivity": "medium"
  }
}
]
```

</details>

This endpoint is a GET and its parameter is a path component in the URL.
Try to find, in the API code, where the URL path is parsed to obtain the `network` name.

ðŸ’» With the API running, _in the other shell_ try to call the "Q4" endpoint (POST):
```bash
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8080/measurements_by_sensor_date \
    -d '{"sensor":"s1001", "date":"2020-07-04"}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' | jq
```
<details><summary>Show expected result</summary>

```
$> curl -s -XPOST localhost:8080/measurements_by_sensor_date \
>     -d '{"sensor":"s1001", "date":"2020-07-04"}' \
>     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' | jq
[
{
  "value": 98,
  "timestamp": "2020-07-04T12:59:59Z"
},
{
  "value": 97,
  "timestamp": "2020-07-04T12:00:01Z"
},
{
  "value": 79,
  "timestamp": "2020-07-04T00:59:59Z"
},
{
  "value": 80,
  "timestamp": "2020-07-04T00:00:01Z"
}
]
```
</details>

In this case, the parameters are passed as POST payload: you can check, in the API code, the way these are parsed and used within the endpoint function body.

## Well done!

Congratulations, your Astra-DB-backed API is running all right!

Now head back to the [main README](../README#homework-instructions) and ... it's time for a little assignment!
